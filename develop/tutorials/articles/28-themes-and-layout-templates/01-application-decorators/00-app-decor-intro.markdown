# Application Decorators [](id=application-decorators)

In previous versions of Liferay, administrators could display or hide the
application borders through the *Show Borders* option of the look and feel
configuration menu. In Liferay 7.0 this option has been replaced with 
Application Decorators, a more powerful mechanism to customize the style of the 
application wrapper.
