# Liferay DXP Trial Plugin Installation [](id=liferay-dxp-trial-plugin-installation)

For Liferay customers who are evaluating Liferay Portal EE on a trial
basis, **the plugins can be accessed from within the Marketplace section
of the Control Panel in the product**. 

*At a later date, the Marketplace website on Liferay.COM will be accessible to
Liferay Portal EE Trial customers. For now, please access EE Plugins through the
portal installation itself.*  

## The Installation Process [](id=the-installation-process)

## FAQ [](id=faq)

**Q:** Where are the "DXP Trial Plugins"?

**A:** There is no such thing. The DXP Plugins in Liferay Marketplace are
the same ones that you get to try out with your DXP Trial license for your
portal. The DXP license (Trial or official DXP Subscriber) gives you access to the
DXP plugins. (Also, there is no difference code-wise or release-wise between a
Liferay Portal DXP Trial installation and a regular Liferay Portal DXP non-Trial
installation. The only difference is the license.)

**Q:** Why can't I go to liferay.com/marketplace? Why can't I "purchase" from the
Marketplace site?

**A:** DXP Trial users must use the Marketplace accessed from within the
product's Control Panel (instructions above). You do not need to
"purchase" any DXP plugins because if you access Marketplace from within
the Control Panel, Marketplace sees that you have an DXP
license installed and gives access to DXP plugins. Official DXP
Subscription customers (i.e., non Trial) will be able to log into
liferay.com with their designated DXP subscriber login and access all DXP
plugins through the Marketplace website. 

**Q:** Why are the plugins under the "Purchased" tab? If I click on the
"DXP Marketplace" link, it does not allow me to get the DXP plugins.

**A:** Once you're signed into the Store, click on the *Purchased* tab,
then click on the *EE* subtab.

**Q:** What happens when DXP Trial customers become official Liferay
Digital Experience subscribers?

**A:** They will still be able to complete the above process, or they
can also visit the [Liferay Marketplace website](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace).

**Q:** Do DXP Trial customers get the DXP source code?

**A:** No, they can only install the plugin. The DXP source code becomes
available once they are official Liferay DXP Enterprise subscribers.

**Q:** Can this process of installing DXP plugins be used from Liferay Portal CE
(Community Edition)?

**A:** No, the Marketplace must detect that you are running Liferay Portal DXP.
