# Managing Liferay with Liferay Connected Services [](id=managing-liferay-with-liferay-connected-services)

Liferay Connected Services (LCS) is a set of online tools and services that lets 
you manage and monitor your Liferay DXP instances. LCS can automatically install 
the fix packs that you choose, monitor your DXP instances' performance, activate 
your DXP instances, and help you manage your DXP subscriptions. In other words, 
LCS is like a butler for the mansion that is Liferay DXP. Even better, the 
features of LCS work regardless of whether your DXP instance is on a single 
discreet server or distributed across a node. It's like having a single butler 
that can serve several mansions at once! You can find more information 
about LCS on its 
[official product page](http://www.liferay.com/products/liferay-connected-services).
