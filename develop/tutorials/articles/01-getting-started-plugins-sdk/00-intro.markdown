# Introduction [](id=introduction)

Liferay 7 introduces a whole new paradigm: component-based development. This
architecture gives developers more flexibility than ever before. Not only are
all components loosely coupled, but they are also managed centrally by Liferay's
OSGi-based component framework. 

The flexibility doesn't end there, though. Previously, Liferay development had
to be done using Liferay's tools: the Plugins SDK at a minimum, and optionally
Liferay's Eclipse-based IDEs, such as Liferay Developer Studio or Liferay IDE.
Now, however, developers don't have to use the Plugins SDK: they can use
whatever they want, so long as they can create components compatible with
Liferay's new OSGi-based component framework. 

That doesn't mean the Plugins SDK isn't supported: it is. If you like the
tooling infrastructure that Liferay provides, it has been updated in this
release to support both traditional Liferay development and development using
the new component framework. 

Read on to get started with writing components for Liferay Portal.
