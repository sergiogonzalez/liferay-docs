# Configuring the LCS Client [](id=configuring-the-lcs-client)

To use LCS, the LCS client app must be installed in your Liferay DXP instance 
and registered with LCS. The LCS client connects your DXP instance to LCS and 
provides a simple UI for managing that connection. You can also use the LCS 
client to directly access your LCS project, environment, and server from within 
your DXP instance. This article covers the following topics to help you get your 
client up and running with LCS:

- [**Downloading the LCS Client:**](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-the-lcs-client#downloading-the-lcs-client)
  The LCS client app comes preinstalled in Liferay DXP bundles. If you installed 
  DXP manually from a WAR file, however, then you must download and install the 
  LCS client manually. Manual download and install is also required if your 
  server connects to the Internet through a proxy, because you must preconfigure 
  the client before deploying it to your server. There may also be other cases, 
  such as updating the client, where you need to download and install the client 
  manually. This section shows you where you can download the LCS client app. 

- [**Preconfiguring the LCS Client to Connect Through a Proxy:**](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-the-lcs-client#preconfiguring-the-lcs-client-to-connect-through-a-proxy)
  If your server connects to the Internet through a proxy, you must preconfigure 
  the LCS client app before you deploy it to your DXP instance. This section 
  shows you how to do this.

- [**Manually Registering the Client with LCS:**](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/configuring-the-lcs-client#manually-registering-the-client-with-lcs)
  Once you've installed the LCS client app, you must register your DXP instance 
  with LCS. You can do this manually or automatically. Manual registration may 
  work, but is deprecated and not recommended. You should instead 
  [register with *environment tokens*](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens). 
  If you still want to manually register your DXP instance with LCS, however, 
  this section shows you how to do so.

Note that to use LCS, you must have an account at 
[Liferay.com](http://www.liferay.com/). 

## Downloading the LCS Client [](id=downloading-the-lcs-client)

You can download the LCS client app from several places. One is the 
[Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace). 
For instructions on using Marketplace, see 
[this user guide article](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-the-liferay-marketplace). 

You can also download the LCS client app from 
[lcs.liferay.com](https://lcs.liferay.com). 
When you first log in, the Welcome screen prompts you to select your Liferay 
version and edition. After doing so, the LCS client's version is listed 
next to a *Download* button. Click this button to download the client. For 
example, the following screenshot shows the Welcome screen with Liferay Portal 
6.2 EE selected. 

![Figure 1: When you first log in to LCS, you can download the LCS client from the Welcome screen.](../../images-dxp/lcs-welcome-client-download.png)

Note that you'll only see the Welcome screen the first time you log in to LCS. 
If you need to download the client again later, you can do so from the Liferay 
Marketplace or the *Connection* tab inside LCS. When you click the *Connection* 
tab, the *Client Downloads* button is automatically selected. This presents the 
same screen as earlier, in which you can download the client. The following 
screenshot shows this: 

![Figure 2: You can also download the LCS client from the Connection tab inside of LCS.](../../images-dxp/lcs-client-download-connection.png)

Super! Now you know where to get the LCS client. Before you deploy it though, 
there are a few other things you should check. If you connect to the web through 
a proxy, proceed to the next section. Otherwise, you can skip this section and 
move on to the section on registering the client with LCS. 

## Preconfiguring the LCS Client to Connect Through a Proxy [](id=preconfiguring-the-lcs-client-to-connect-through-a-proxy)

In most cases, deploying and configuring the LCS client is simple. If, however,
you connect to the web through a proxy, there are some properties you need to 
set in the client's WAR file before deploying it. Specifically, you need to set 
these properties in the client's `portlet-ext.properties` file. Regardless of 
the properties you're setting, the procedure doing so is the same. 

1. In the LCS client's WAR file, open the 
   `WEB-INF/classes/portlet-ext.properties` file.
 
2. Make your changes in the file.

3. Update the LCS client WAR with the modified `portlet-ext.properties` file.

4. Deploy the LCS client WAR or redeploy it if it's already deployed. 

To connect to LCS through a proxy, add the following properties at the end of 
`portlet-ext.properties` and set them to the appropriate values for your proxy.
   
        proxy.host.name=
        proxy.host.port=

If your proxy uses authentication, you should also add the following properties 
and set them to the appropriate values for your proxy.
   
        proxy.host.login=
        proxy.host.password= 

Great! Now you're ready to deploy the client and register your Liferay DXP 
instance with LCS. 

## Manually Registering the Client with LCS [](id=manually-registering-the-client-with-lcs)

Once you deploy the LCS client, you're ready to register your server with LCS. 

+$$$

**Warning:** The manual registration steps in this section are deprecated, and 
may not work. 
[Using an environment token](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#using-environment-tokens) 
is the preferred way to register your server with LCS. 

$$$

Access the client by clicking on *Liferay Connected Services* under the 
*Configuration* section of the *Control Panel*. 

![Figure 3: LCS appears in the Control Panel's Configuration section.](../../images-dxp/lcs-control-panel-dxp.png)

The LCS client first asks you to choose the LCS services you want to enable for 
this DXP instance. The *Enable All Services* checkbox is selected by default. 
This enables portal analytics, fix pack management, and portal property 
analysis. Unchecking this checkbox presents you with additional checkboxes for 
enabling each of those services. Note that although 
[LCS doesn't access security sensitive properties](/discover/deployment/-/knowledge_base/7-0/using-lcs#what-lcs-stores-about-your-liferay-servers), 
you may have additional properties you want to prevent LCS from analyzing. If 
you select *Portal Properties Analysis*, a text box appears for you to enter any 
properties you don't want LCS to analyze. Click *Next* when you finish enabling 
the LCS services you want to use. 

![Figure 4: If you unselect *Enable All Services*, you can enable each LCS service that you want to use with your DXP instance.](../../images-dxp/lcs-enable-services.png)

Next, LCS asks you to authorize access to your LCS account. After clicking 
*Authorize Access*, LCS takes you to the LCS website. Log in with your 
credentials and then click *Grant Access*. 

![Figure 5: The LCS client requires access to your LCS account.](../../images-dxp/lcs-auth-access.png)

Now you must register your server with LCS by filling out the following fields:

1. Connected Services Project: Choose an existing LCS project from the menu. If 
   you don't yet have an LCS project, you can use the default *My LCS Project* 
   that LCS creates for you (you can change this project's name later). 

2. Environment: An environment should be a logical group of servers. A group of 
   development servers or a cluster are good examples of environments. Select an 
   existing environment from the menu, or create a new one by clicking the *Add 
   New Environment* button. If you don't yet have an environment, you can use 
   the default *My Environment* that LCS creates for you (you can change this 
   environment's name later). If you elect to create a new environment, a popup 
   asks you to enter the new environment's *Name*, *Location*, and 
   *Description*. 

    ![Figure 6: The Add New Environment pop-up.](../../images-dxp/lcs-new-environment.png)

3. Server Name: Give your server a name that you can use to distinguish it LCS. 
   Note that server names in LCS aren't case sensitive. Also, you can't have 
   duplicate server names in an environment. For example, you can't have servers 
   named *server01* and *SERVER01* in the same environment. 

4. Server Location: This can be a city, location in an office building, or 
   anywhere else that lets you know where the server is physically located.

5. Server Description: Type in any description that you want to give your 
   server. You can use this field to help differentiate the servers you manage 
   with LCS.

![Figure 7: The server registration screen.](../../images-dxp/lcs-register-server.png)

Upon clicking *Register*, your LCS client shows your connection status. Note 
that it can take up to 10 or 20 seconds to perform the initial handshake and 
send the first batch of information to LCS. If you don't see any change in 
status after 20 seconds, try refreshing the page. If you see a red symbol 
indicating no data is being transmitted, please contact the Liferay team for 
support. 

Once a successful connection is established, some statistics and links are
displayed. Here's a description of what's displayed:

- **Heartbeat Interval:** The interval of the communication that maintains the 
  connection with LCS. This regular communication keeps the client's LCS 
  connection alive, even when there's nothing else to report. The value is 
  listed in hours, minutes, and then seconds. For example, if this value is 
  `00:01:00`, the client communicates with LCS once every minute. This article's 
  previous section contains instructions for changing the heartbeat interval.
- **Message Task Interval:** The interval at which the client checks LCS for new 
  messages. For example, LCS messages are used to instruct the client to 
  download new fix packs. Currently, this interval is fixed and can't be 
  changed. 
- **Metrics Task Interval:** The interval at which server statistics and metrics 
  are sent to LCS. Currently, this interval is fixed and can't be changed. 
- **Last Message Received:** The time the latest message was received from LCS.
- **Connection Uptime:** The duration of the client's connection with LCS.
- **Project Home:** This link takes you to this server's registered LCS project. 
  The project home in LCS is also called the *dashboard*.
- **Environment:** This link takes you to this server's registered environment.
- **Server Dashboard:** This link takes you to the server on LCS.
- **Configure Services:** This link lets you change which LCS services are 
  enabled for your DXP instance. Doing so triggers reconnection with the new 
  settings. 
- **Disconnect:** Disconnects this DXP instance from LCS.

Awesome! Now that you've registered your server with your LCS account, you can 
dig in to the features of LCS.
