You've been using Liferay as a developer for some time now; you've read
documentation and blogs and have maybe even gone through some training. More
importantly, you have already developed some portlets and extensions. You may
have heard about Liferay 7 or are even about to start a new project using it and
want to find out what is new and how you can leverage the new features. We have
good news for you. Liferay 7 contains lots of improvements for developers; and
this tutorial series shows you how to make the best of them.

This series orients Liferay developers with all the improvements that Liferay 7
offers. It describes the benefits of Liferay 7's for developers compared to
previous versions, the changes that modularity brings, how to develop modules
and how they differ from plugins, and comprehensive tutorials, of course, on how
to upgrade existing developments.

You'll be able to apply your existing knowledge of portlet and theme development
and portal customization to Liferay 7, too. And with regards to plugin upgrades,
we lay out all the options, explain the pros and cons of each, and demonstrate
common steps for adapting existing plugins to Liferay 7. Lastly, we explain how
and when to modularize plugins.

We not only want you to adapt to Liferay 7, we want you to thrive using it.

Let’s first look at what’s changed the most since Liferay 6 and then call out
the familiar, good things that remain the same.
